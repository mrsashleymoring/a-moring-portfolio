                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Ashley.<br>
                        <br>I am a web developer learning everything I can about making beautiful & functional websites.  I love to spend time with my wonderful family, visit beautiful places and enjoy life.<br>
                        <br>I graduated from college with a BA in Psychology from Chaminade University, but never pursued a career in the field.  I started working in the restaurant industry while going to school and I never stopped.  I’ve worked for some amazing companies that have given me tremendous opportunity to grow as a person and a leader.  I have been fortunate enough to work and travel, build a family and meet some amazing people all over the world.<br>
                        <br>I have always felt that I have been on a lifelong search to find my passion. I never had one thing that I wanted to pursue until I discovered what it is like to create, build, and grow on the web.  I started taking classes with Skillcrush and I have enjoyed every minute of it.<br>
                        <br>My dream job is to work remotely…wherever that may be.</p>
